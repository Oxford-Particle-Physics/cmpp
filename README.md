# Computational Methods for Particle Physics


Lecture slides, jupyter notebooks and datasets that go along with the lecture series to introduce computation methods and tools that might be useful for particle physics research. The lectures were initially put together by Matthew Bass and modified by Giacomo Artoni. This is the updated version for 2022.

There are four lectures in total and material for each can be found in the dedicated folder. External datasets are in the Dataset folder so make sure to always grab those.

All of the examples require a working python implementation 

## Suggested ways to get the data

- Download the content of the gitlab repository or single directories as a zip file
- Import it into your personal gitlab/github

## Executing the notebooks

- If jupyter notebooks is part of your python environment, from the terminal execute `jupyter notebook` from within the desired folder
- Use CERN Swan environment
- Use Google Colab environment
- Use docker

For details on the above check out the slides from Lecture 1 "Introduction"
